# Angular Bootstrap Express Template

I did this out of boredom and this will probably become useful for me in the future.

## Setup

1. Navigate to project directory
2. Run `npm install` in Terminal
3. Run `bower install` in Terminal
4. Run `npm start` in Terminal
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Using Sass

1. Open a new Terminal window/tab and navigate to the project directory
2. Run `gulp`
3. Edit `sass/style.scss` for CSS changes. Gulp will automatically update `public/style.css` when saving the `style.scss` file.
